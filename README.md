# soot-ui
A set of dark UI components for Vue 2 apps. Includes a demo in the repo with an example of all components.
Not currently compatible with vue-cli-service >=v4.0.0 - designed for use in projects with v3.6.0.

Still in early development.

### Working with the repository
```
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm start          # Shorthand for npm run serve
npm run serve      # Serve the demo page, live reloading when components change on disk
npm run build      # Run the production build (minified, doesn't include demo HTML page)
npm run build:demo # Build the demo page for offline viewing
npm run watch      # Run the production build, re-running when components change on disk
npm run watch:demo # Run the demo build, re-running when components change on disk
```
